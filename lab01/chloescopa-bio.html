    <h1>Chloe Scopa's Biography</h1>
    <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    <p>
My name is Chloe Scopa, and I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Communication & Rhetorical Studies along with a dual minor in Psychology & Information Management & Technology at Syracuse University. I bear a passion for creative marketing as well as fashion communications and am interested in working with companies to successfully deliver messages to their intended markets. I am skilled within my interpersonal expertise, possess a unique perspective, and pride myself in my abilities to connect and understand people. I am currently involved with <strong>Zipped magazine</strong>, a premier student-run-non-profit fashion magazine as a Marketing and Public Relations Assistant. In addition, I recently joined University Union, Syracuse’s official student programming board, working on their social media e-board team. Outside of my work, I enjoy thrift shopping, making my own jewelry, knitting over tea with my mom and sister, and creating my own vision boards on Pinterest!
